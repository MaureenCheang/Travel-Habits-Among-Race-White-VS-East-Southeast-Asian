# Project: Tourism & Inflation Study and Infographic

## Overview
For this specific project, utilizing existing data on travel habits between White people and East/Southeast Asian individuals can provide valuable insights into the influence of cultural background on travel preferences and behaviours. This data can help researchers, tourism businesses, and policymakers better understand diverse cultural needs and preferences in travel. By identifying market opportunities, supporting diversity and inclusivity, informing public policy, and promoting cross-cultural understanding, such a study can contribute to more effective and inclusive tourism strategies, products, and policies. 

## Data Source(s)
This dataset is provided by CRG. Context Research Group is a recognized member of the Canadian Research Insights Council (CRIC), as such, their studies and reports are aligned with the CRIC Public Opinion Research Standards. Moreover, the project contains two datasets - the original and the cleaned data. The cleaned data was used to create an infographic on Infogram.

## Research Questions
This project analyzed on several key questions to provide insighs in travel habits among races:
What is the sample distribution?
What is the annual income level before tax among these two races?
How important is 'Green Economy' when making choice of leisure travel destination?
What is the primary factor influencing getaway choices?
Which activites would be interested in participating for the next leisure travel trip?(multiple select)
what is your preferred duration for the next leisure travel trip?

## Key Insights


## Limitations
This project focuses on developing a unique narrative based on the original dataset. The analysis is based on the selected questions, which may not provide a comprehensive view. Additionally, most respondents were residents of North America, potentially skewing the demographic distribution and not fully representing the travel habits of the two racial groups. Although the dataset was provided by a reputable company, the absence of information on correlation and standard deviation may limit the depth of analysis and warrant further consideration.
